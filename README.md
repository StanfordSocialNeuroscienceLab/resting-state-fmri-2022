# resting-state-fmri-2022
Preprocessing and analysis scripts for the SSNL's 2022 Resting State analyses


## Directories in this Repo

* `analysis`: To be updated throughout the project
* `preprocessing`: Scripts to run `fmriprep` at the subject-level (optimized for a HPC cluster)
* `utility`: Scripts to organize and compile the dataset before analysis


The majority of our analysis pipeline is built on <a href="https://github.com/IanRFerguson/glm-express" target="_blank">`GLM Express`</a>, a
lightweight modeling utility. Please <a href="mailto:IRF229@nyu.edu" target="_blank"><b>hit me up</b></a> with any questions or comments about our work!
